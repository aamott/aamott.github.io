        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p><b>Tina Welch</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Occupation: Accountant
            <li>Demographics and Education: 40 years old. Bachelor’s degree in accounting and mother of 1 child in school. Lives in Rigby, Idaho and has for most of her life.</li>
            <li>Motivation for using the site: Keep up to date on the weather, especially during the winter when school might be cancelled because of snow. Checks the weather before outings with her family. </li>
            <li>Social: Enjoys hiking with her family in her brief moments of free time. Her parents visit every summer and Christmas, but they were late last Christmas when a snowstorm closed the airport. </li>
            <li>Technology: A big fan of Apple, she uses an old MacBook as her daily driver. Recently, her husband got her a new iPhone which she has begun using for almost anything outside of typing. She prefers convenience over high tech.  </li>
            <li>Quote: “I wish everything could be as organized as numbers. Sometimes life just gets chaotic!”
        </ul>

        <p><b>Rob Hopkins</b></p>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Occupation: Car salesman</li>
            <li>Demographics and Education: 27 years old. Bachelor’s in Business and graduate from BYU Idaho, but currently living in Salt Lake City where he works. </li>
            <li>Motivation for using the site: By staying up to date on the weather, John can sometimes use it as a point of sales for customers. Last week, someone came in and bought a Subaru Impreza after it snowed for 2 weeks after he came in looking for a sports car. In addition, he checks it before visiting his girlfriend, so he doesn’t get stuck on his way up or back. </li> 
            <li>Social: His girlfriend is still working on her degree at BYU, Idaho, where he visits whenever he can. </li>
            <li>Technology: Loves technology but can barely afford the Chromebook he has now. If it were not so important for job searches and work, he would have stuck with his phone, a cheap Android he found on Amazon for $60.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Will mom and dad be able to fly in the week before Christmas, or do they need to postpone or come early?</li>
            <li>Is school likely to be cancelled?</li>
            <li>Will it be good weather for a hike with my family today?</li>
            <li>Should I offer more all-wheel drive cars for snow, or stick with the normal selection?</li>
        </ul>
